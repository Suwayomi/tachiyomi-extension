# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Suwayomi Extension
This repository contains the Suwayomi extension for [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) and variants.

# Usage

The Extension can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Tachiyomi app and variants. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

[Add the extension repo to your app using this link](https://suwayomi.org/tachiyomi-extension)

Or by manually adding this to the extension repos: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suwayomi/tachiyomi-extension/repo/index.min.json`

## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK file, it is available directly in this GitHub repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/suwayomi/tachiyomi-extension/tree/repo/apk).
